#Placement Prediction README

#Overview
This repository contains a dataset and code for a Placement Prediction System. The system is designed to predict whether a person can be able to get a placement or not. The dataset includes information of the person's age,CGPA,History of Backlogs,Number of internships,Hosteler or not,Gender.

#Dataset
The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format with the following columns:
Age: Numeric variable representing the person's age.
Gender: Categorical variable indicating the gender of the person.
Stream: Categorical variable representing the academic stream (e.g., Computer Science , Electronics And Communication , Information Technology).
History of Backlogs: Categorical variable indicating the number of backlogs a person has.
Internships: Categorical variable representing the number of internships completed by the person.
CGPA: Numeric variable indicating the Cumulative Grade Point Average of the person.
Hosteler: Binary variable indicating whether the person is a hosteler or not (1 for yes, 0 for no).
Placed or not: Binary variable indicating whether the person has been placed or not (1 for placed, 0 for not placed).


#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Summary Statistics:
Calculate and display summary statistics for numerical features (e.g., age, CGPA, number of internships). This includes mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

Distribution Analysis:
Visualize the distribution of each numerical variable using histograms or kernel density plots. This helps in understanding the spread and central tendency of the data.

Categorical Variables:
Explore the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., gender, stream, hosteler) using bar charts. Understand the proportion of each category within the dataset.

Feature Relationships:
Explore how different features relate to the target variable. For instance, you can create bar plots to show the average placement rate based on different categories (e.g., gender, stream).

Missing Values:
Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on an appropriate strategy for handling them. This might involve imputation or removal of rows with missing values.

Data Outliers:
Identify and examine any outliers in the data. Consider whether they are genuine data points or errors, and decide on an appropriate action, such as removing or transforming them.

Data Quality Check:
Ensure the data is consistent and accurate. Check for any anomalies or discrepancies in the values of features.

Visualizations:
Utilize various visualizations such as bar charts to provide a comprehensive view of the dataset.


#Explore the dataset using the provided Jupyter notebook or any other analysis tool.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data if necessary. Handle missing values and outliers.

Model Training:
Use the dataset to train a machine learning model for Placement Prediction using algorithms like Decision Tree,K-NN,RBF SVM and XGBoost.

Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict the placement based on the factors.
